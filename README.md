## Description

- This is a super simple form on a FE just to show the API working as expected, mainly because of time struggles. (Don't judge how naff the UI looks :'( )
- If I had more time I'd add proper validation to the inputs, but as of right now, to see it working you have to put in valid values. That work would include unit tests too of course
- I'd also show the returned data in a better way, textarea was the fastest thing to use that I could think of
- This app could do with better state handling too, mainly to allow for easier cross-input validations (like making sure the addresses inputted aren't the same)
